## Introduction to Computer Networking

In this section, you will get an overview of computer networking, its importance, and its applications in the modern world. We'll cover topics like the Internet, the OSI model, and the role of networks in enabling communication between devices.

## Networking Basics

Learn the fundamental concepts that form the building blocks of computer networking. Topics covered include IP addressing, subnetting, DNS (Domain Name System), DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), and more.

## Networking Protocols

Dive into the world of networking protocols, understanding how data is transmitted and received across networks. We'll explore popular protocols like HTTP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP, along with their use cases.

## TCP/IP Fundamentals

TCP/IP is the backbone of modern networking. In this section, you'll delve deeper into the TCP/IP suite, understanding its layers, functions, and its role in connecting devices across the internet.

## Network Devices

Explore the various network devices used in creating and managing networks. Topics include routers, switches, firewalls, access points, and network cables.

## Local Area Networks (LAN)

Understand the concept of Local Area Networks, how they are set up, and their applications in connecting devices within a limited geographical area.

## Wide Area Networks (WAN)

Learn about Wide Area Networks and how they facilitate communication between geographically dispersed locations. We'll cover technologies like MPLS, leased lines, and VPNs (Virtual Private Networks).

## Network Security

Security is a crucial aspect of networking. This section covers the basics of network security, including encryption, authentication, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.

## Troubleshooting Networks

Network issues are common, and knowing how to troubleshoot them is essential. In this section, you'll learn common network troubleshooting techniques and tools.
